//  May 13 - initial commit
// May 14 - working on making activities and scheduleBlocks
// working on archiving schedules - basic mechanism works, but need more testing
// can make and retrieve schedules - only blocks with activities are created
// working on SignUp page - can display and select cells - need to generalize logic
// will display one day at a time (2 sections)  need Next and Back butons in header view
// Next and back buttons work for SignUp - but do we want Back button?? would have to de-register users
// admin will have ten sections that scroll
// also need to register users - done for fake user SK
// can now add participants - and see weekly schedule
// admin can add or remove participant in activity - results saved
// show activities as full as needed and make them unselectable
// both selected cells show as highlighted
// added green checkmarks
// added CalendarDays and view only Mondays
// changed Back button to Done for SignUp page and made unwind segue
//  working on conversion to Week based app - need to retrieve specific week and also do sign up stuff
// can retrieve desired week and sign up - admin can edit user list and results are saved
//  NEXT - reorganize admin pages, add reprting and printing and option to print specific schedule - also restricted schedule option when register user
// Now register users available times - and only available times are displayed for sign up
// added ReportGenerator to help with output
// added function to get the schedule for one user
// added more functions to get weeks within range and delete weeks within range
// also to get user schedule within a range - must test all of these
// added activity counting -
// admin can now remove activities - all seems to work for admin editting
// added tracking of last login for participants
// made a PDF report that actually shows schedule for a week - can do series of weeks, and blank schedule for current week
// also can make activity report for an individual - could make it prettier and add the date range to title
//  can make individual activity summary or generate ALL
// the email button and print button both work
// added protection for double entry of activity and double registration
// fixed deselection process
// added alerts for blank fields and print option from ParticipantManager
// aded ScrollView to ActivityManagerVC
// updated layouts and added admin password
// started playing with setupUI for colors - must have alpha = 1 for view background color
// more layout work - NEED BIG FONT for nav bar
